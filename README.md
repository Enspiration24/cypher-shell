## How to build

Use `make help` to list possible tasks. But you probably want either

*  `make dist`
   which will build a runnable script for you at `neo4j-shell/build/install/neo4j-shell`

* `make zip`
   which builds a runnable script and packages it up for you as: `out/neo4j-shell.zip`

You can then just run the executable under the `bin/` sub-directory.
